	Buelta opened her eyes. It was dead dark in her room. To the left of her bed, the tree scraped a skittering wask against the glass of her window. 

	She waited. She listened. 

	The noise was a simple tune she'd listened to since fall when the tree grew wide enough to touch the bedroom window before the leaves all fell off. Now it took a moderate breeze for the branches to sway enough to make the noise.

	Wask, Sheeew... Wask, sheeeww...  Wask, sheeeew.

	No other noise came from the rest of the house.

	She threw off her bedding, and jumped out of bed. She'd gone to bed early already dressed in tomorrow's clothes. Buelta tossed a pair of socks on and picked up her bulky boots before she left the room. She was extra carefull closing her door. She pulled in a deep breath and held it until she crept quietly down the hall past Old Nan's door. She stiffled her steps down a case of stairs. She snuck around a cooridoor. She passed a hall of familly portraits. She walked down another set of stairs, making sure to hopscotch the third step from the bottom which always squeeked. Through the kitchens she shuffled her other boot into her right hand so she could grab a dried salami sausage hanging near the oven. She made her way through the back door. Now that she was in the open air, sausage under her armpit, she knelt down and shuffled her shoes on. 

	She looked at the deep horizon, noting that the sky was becoming lighter past the trees on the far hills. She smiled as a chill wind whisked by her face and she breathed deeply. She snapped the sausage in half and took a bite as she set off down the road that lead toward town, not taking a single look back at her familly home as she left. This was her day and she was going to see it used to its fullest.
