ch#N.txt will be the actual story.
All the other files are about the world in general. Items, places, people, things and ideas.
Not everything in these files will make their way into the story itself, but should generally be used to shape the world and maybe set the mood while writing. I generally want a bright world similar to our own where humans were basically given power over creation. Dark things have occured, often as accidents or bad ideas that got loose. We generally are in an anarchical state, where governments and agencies tend to work from the shadows.
I don't want to touch on our world's religion. Religion in their world may or may not be used as plot devices. World religions are like governments, hidden though sometimes referenced.
