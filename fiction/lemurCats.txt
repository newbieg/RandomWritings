Lemurcats:
	Agile and cunning, lemurcats are neither monkey, nor cat. They are something in between. 
Created some time ago by a lonely maji who wanted her cats to be more like children, the result was not to her expectations. They did not quite take to being tamed, and many quickly sprung loose from her care. A lemurcat tends to be very curious, loves shiny things, and tends to pounce on small things that move. They tend to rome forested areas in troops of between 3 and 15, to test whether a lemurcat troop is in the area one should roll a coin down the path you are walking on. 

	Lemurcats are territorial, but will follow humans several miles past their territory if those humans have mirrors, rings and adornments, or cary purses that jingle. It is the lemurcat's hope that this person will fall asleep soon and said lemurcat could then quickly and silently rob the person.

	Other than their grand ideas about larsony and ownership over the shinies, a lemurcat is otherwise a peacefull, friendly sort of creature. Often a traveller who has become lost in the forrest comes back with stories of how they were escorted back to safety (perhaps with slightly lighter pockets, but generally lighter spirits).
