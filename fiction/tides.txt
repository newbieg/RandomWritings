Tides:
	Tides are great blankets of cursed fog. A malicious sourcerer thousands of years ago created these wheather banks that gather and expand for miles. They feed off of depression. They are infectious. They are released from pockets of aeither that the sourcerer hid throughout his path. The tide is released in great waves throughout the land, spreading mass depression at random. 
	Tides have been known to take whole towns, molding and shaping a happy village into a massive dump. When this happens many people go away for a few months in the hopes that the clouds won't follow and that when they come back the fog has disapated. Unfortunately, some people aslo feed off of depression, so the clouds do not always leave, but rather follow this person as they feed off eachother. In this case the only way towards a cure is to take the person outside of themselves (a painfull proceedure that sometimes results in a complete change of character).

	Most aeither pockets have been found and the roving tides generally only occur in areas that are underpopulated and even then they have lost some of their potency, though a few nasty tides still exist and could capture an unwary traveller.
