Cloud Animals

Cloud animals are real, living things. They run accross the sky in search of inanimate clouds that they can eat. There are cloud elephants, cloud giraffes, even cloud dragons. People often spend the evenings watching a cloud elephant and her baby munching down on a cloud tree as the wind slowly pushes them across the sky.
