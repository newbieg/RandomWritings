Cloud Animals

Cloud animals are real, living things. They run accross the sky in search of inanimate clouds that they can eat. There are cloud elephants, cloud giraffes, even cloud dragons. People often spend the evenings watching a cloud elephant and her baby munching down on a cloud tree as the wind slowly pushes them across the sky.

Cloud animals tend to eat, and eat, and eat. They become so bloated that they cover the sky and become quite dark gray. At this point people know well to enter their dwellings, because it's obvious what's about to happen. The rain can last for hours, even days in the case of bloated dragons. At the end of it all the dragon or elephant has passed and the world's plants will absorb that rain, which then evaporates into sky grass and sky trees which feed the young orphaned sky animals. Such is the cycle of clouds.

Some speculate that there are no sky people because all sky animals are just figments of our imagination, that they are just the results of gusts of wind and our own minds trying to make sense of the chaos. They obviously have not flown up there to see the elephants up close, for they would certainly drop this kind of speculation after an angry skybeast charges you in protection of their babes. Just because you don't see people in the field before you doesn't mean that people do not exist. Speculating on the lack of something cannot take away from the wonder that is before your very eyes.
