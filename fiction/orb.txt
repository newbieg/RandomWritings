The ORB

Back when Buelta was a kid, she doesn't remember how old exactly but about 5, she had a nurse maid.
Buelta's nurse maid would tell her stories every night about a brave knight and his strange adventures.
Some times the knight would climb a cliff, fight a dragon, and rescue a damsel in distress. 
Other times the knight was a young man, just getting a start in the world, and was thrust into strange situations where he didn't have any control.
There were even wars the knight took part in, where an evil overlord was ultimately vanquished and the land was saved.
But there was one evening in which the orb was mentioned. The knight vanquished a dark maji, released his prisoners, and closed the castle. Then he went into the room with no door. He sat down in front of the orb, and his mind was lost as the years passed on without him. 

Buelta was young, and she'd begun to care deeply for the knight, and the story was strange. She must have made a fuss the next day about nightmares, because her parents told the nursemaid never to tell her stories again. Soon after, she was sent away and Buelta never heard of her again.
