The knight:
Ideas : is he a villain? is this why her parents were upset that the nursemaid had told these stories? Or was he in fact a great man, but they didn't like that she was told a dark story. Well, they are dark maji hunters. I think it would make more sense that he was in fact a dark maji. One that was well known. They didn't like that the nursemaid had told their daughter about him in a way that made him apear relatable. It would also trigger an alarm, how does she know so much about this bad person, does she know him and hold a grudge?

OOOH! What if Buelta is in fact adopted and this knight is in fact her father?

This might be worth aluding to. We may need some interaction between Buelta and her parents, not just Old Nan.
