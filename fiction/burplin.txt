Burplin:

	While many believe that the burplin was created as some kind of grinsday prank, it was in fact made on the forth of Thimbry, a very normal Coseday afternoon. The alchemist, sir Isaac Nortsmere, had an idea of how to harness the power of the human breath. He fused a wind element with a spirit of enlightenment, then gave it the instructions that it should hide itself in meals that have gone cold. When the spirit felt the preasure build up around itself, it should utilize it's wind counterpart and release itself, gathering the kinetic energy around it.
	Nortsmere knew much about energies and pressure, but not much about human anatomy. A burplin often felt the preasure as a result of the human host being at their most nervous which means the burp always comes out at what might be considered the worst timing. We probably should not mention what happens if a burplin doesn't find time to be burped out soon enough. Once a year the burplins return to the place of their birth in order to deposit their prizes. Nortsmere never returned to his mansion after the first aniversary of creating the burplins.
