Buelta is a young and hugely gifted magic user. She is especially gifted in Sonic Manipulation.

Her familly is rich, like near royal nobility style rich. Her parents are members of a group of high ranking persons who catch people who misuse majic.

On the surface she is dificult to approach and rightly so. Most people in town see her as the future heir to basically the whole town, but also to her parent's legacy as a dark maji hunter. People in town are polite to, but also a bit afraid of her family. Having a maji hunter in town is like having ancient totems burried under your house. They are there to protect you from the beasts at your door, but you also have a bit of anxiety should something go wrong and it focus it'sintent upon you. You hear stories and rumors all the time.
