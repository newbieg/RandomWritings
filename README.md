# RandomWritings
"I have an idea for a book" I said for the twelfth time. So I started a git repo for books that I intend to start and never finish.

A novel tends to be between 300,000 words and 600,000. I tend to write about 600 words per day on days that I feel like writing. So I might have a finished product in 20 years. Wish me luck.

To participate in this project simply fork, push your idea and ask for an upstream. If you have read all the available chapters and the content you write adds something interesting to the story then it will very likely be added into the book. This should be treated as a colaborative effort. Anything you add to this story should be considered to be under the same license. The license on this project is basically MIT or Zlib. Attribution and basic protection clause as to the product's merchantability.
